# Page Summarizer Chrome Extension

A production-ready Chrome Extension that uses AI to generate concise summaries of web pages.

## Features

- ü§ñ **AI-Powered Summaries**: Uses OpenRouter API to access multiple LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, etc.)
- ‚ö° **TL;DR Generation**: Automatically generates ultra-concise one-sentence summaries alongside detailed summaries
- üìè **Adaptive Summary Length**: Automatically adjusts summary length based on original text size - short articles get concise summaries, long articles get comprehensive ones
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Reading Time Analysis**: Shows estimated reading time for original content vs summary, with time savings percentage
- üåç **Multi-Language Support**: Choose summary language or auto-detect from original content
- üìù **Smart Text Extraction**: Automatically detects and extracts main content from web pages
- ‚ö° **Quick Access**: Summarize via browser action, context menu, or popup
- üé® **Modern UI**: Clean interface with dark/light mode support
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Customizable**: Choose AI model, summary length preference (concise/balanced/detailed), language, and theme
- üìã **Copy to Clipboard**: Easy sharing of generated summaries with TL;DR included
- üîß **Quick Settings**: Access and modify all settings directly from the popup interface

## TL;DR Feature

The extension now includes an intelligent TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read) feature that provides instant understanding of any content:

### What is TL;DR?

- **Ultra-concise summary**: A single sentence that captures the most essential point of the entire content
- **Instant understanding**: Get the main takeaway without reading the full summary
- **Dual AI processing**: Separate AI requests ensure both TL;DR and detailed summary are optimized for their purpose

### How it Works

1. **Dual Generation**: When you summarize content, the extension makes two separate AI requests:

   - One for the detailed summary (adaptive length based on content)
   - One specifically for the TL;DR (always one sentence)

2. **Smart Display**: The TL;DR appears prominently above the main summary with distinctive styling

3. **Language Consistency**: TL;DR respects your language settings, appearing in the same language as your summary preference

### Visual Design

- **Prominent placement**: TL;DR appears at the top with a green border and "TL;DR:" label
- **Clear hierarchy**: Visually distinct from the main summary while maintaining design consistency
- **Responsive layout**: Adapts to different themes (light/dark mode)

### Copy Functionality

When you copy the summary to clipboard, both TL;DR and the full summary are included:

```
TL;DR: [One sentence summary]

[Full detailed summary]
```

### Benefits

- **Quick scanning**: Instantly understand if the full content is worth your time
- **Meeting preparation**: Get key points for discussions without reading everything
- **Social sharing**: Perfect length for sharing the essence of articles
- **Information triage**: Quickly categorize and prioritize content consumption

## Reading Time Analysis

The extension now includes intelligent reading time analysis that helps you understand the time savings from using summaries:

### What it Shows

- **Time Saved**: Shows both absolute time saved and percentage reduction from reading the summary instead of the full content

### How it Works

- Uses an average reading speed of 180 words per minute (realistic for web content reading)
- Accurately counts words in both original text and summary
- Displays time in a user-friendly format (minutes for short content, hours and minutes for longer content)
- Shows percentage savings to help you understand the efficiency gain

### Example Display

```
Time saved: 6 min (75%)
```

This feature helps you:

- **Understand the value** of using summaries for time management
- **Make informed decisions** about when to read the full content vs the summary
- **Track your reading efficiency** across different types of content

## Quick Settings in Popup

The extension now features a convenient settings panel directly in the popup interface:

### Accessing Quick Settings

1. Click the extension icon to open the popup
2. Click the dropdown arrow (‚åÑ) next to the settings gear icon
3. The settings panel will expand, showing all available options

### Available Quick Settings

- **Model Selection**: Choose between GPT-4o, GPT-4o Mini, Claude Sonnet 4, Gemini, and Grok 3 Beta
- **Summary Length**: Select Concise, Balanced, or Detailed preferences
- **Language**: Choose from 20+ supported languages or use Auto-detect
- **Theme**: Switch between Auto (System), Light, or Dark themes

### Benefits

- **Instant Access**: No need to open the full settings page for common adjustments
- **Real-time Changes**: Settings are saved automatically as you change them
- **Theme Preview**: See theme changes applied immediately
- **Compact Design**: Settings panel fits seamlessly within the popup interface

## Language Support

The extension supports summaries in multiple languages:

### Supported Languages

- **Auto (Original Language)**: Automatically detects and uses the same language as the source content
- **English** - English
- **–†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π** - Russian
- **Espa√±ol** - Spanish
- **Fran√ßais** - French
- **Deutsch** - German
- **Italiano** - Italian
- **Portugu√™s** - Portuguese
- **‰∏≠Êñá** - Chinese
- **Êó•Êú¨Ë™û** - Japanese
- **ÌïúÍµ≠Ïñ¥** - Korean
- **ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿäÿ©** - Arabic
- **‡§π‡§ø‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•Ä** - Hindi
- **T√ºrk√ße** - Turkish
- **Polski** - Polish
- **Nederlands** - Dutch
- **Svenska** - Swedish
- **Dansk** - Danish
- **Norsk** - Norwegian
- **Suomi** - Finnish

### How Language Selection Works

1. **Auto Mode (Default)**: The AI automatically detects the language of the original content and generates the summary in the same language
2. **Specific Language**: Choose any supported language to force summaries in that language, regardless of the source content language
3. **Intelligent Translation**: When a specific language is selected, the AI not only translates but also adapts the summary to be natural and culturally appropriate for that language

## Adaptive Summary System

The extension now features an intelligent summary length system that adapts to the original text size:

### How it Works

- **Very short texts** (< 200 words): 1-3 sentences
- **Short texts** (200-500 words): 2-5 sentences
- **Medium texts** (500-1000 words): 3-7 sentences
- **Long texts** (1000-2000 words): 5-10 sentences
- **Very long texts** (2000-5000 words): 8-15 sentences
- **Extremely long texts** (5000+ words): 10-20 sentences

### Length Preferences

Your length preference (Concise/Balanced/Detailed) acts as a multiplier:

- **Concise**: 20% shorter summaries
- **Balanced**: Standard adaptive length
- **Detailed**: 30% longer summaries

This ensures that:

- Short articles aren't over-summarized into meaningless fragments
- Long articles get comprehensive summaries that preserve important details
- User preferences are still respected across all text lengths
